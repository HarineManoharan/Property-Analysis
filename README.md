Project Overview
The Property Analysis Project is designed to help investors, real estate agents, and individuals make data-driven decisions about property investments by analyzing various factors that influence property values and investment potential. This tool integrates data on transportation stations, modes of transportation, crime incidents, rental values, house values, and local schools to provide a comprehensive analysis. By evaluating these factors, the project helps users assess the overall attractiveness and profitability of different properties, offering insights into neighborhood quality, safety, and potential return on investment (ROI).
